## About

Product Design & UX Lead with 15+ years designing and shipping digital products.

Before founding **Focuswave** in 2017, I served as **Head of Mobile at Condé Nast**, where I led the launch of 20+ apps for brands like *Vogue*, *GQ*, and *Vanity Fair*. I also co-founded [**Wigoo.com**](http://wigoo.com/), an early no-code platform for building mobile apps, and taught Mobile Design & UX at **Gobelins** in Paris.

Today I help companies turn ideas into products that balance user needs and business goals—combining:

- Design leadership
- User experience
- Product design
- Webflow development
- AI-assisted workflows

**My current focus:** AI micro-apps and how design and code are converging into a unified workflow.

## AI Micro-Apps

I use AI coding agents (Claude, Cursor) with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS to design and build compact applications that demonstrate real product craft.

### 🎮 Skills Explorer

Interactive word-search game that replaces a traditional CV.

- Built from scratch with no external game libraries
- Custom grid generation with word placement algorithm
- Canvas-based selection detection and hint animations
- Web Audio API synthesis that reacts to user actions
- Progress tracking with confetti celebrations

### 🎨 Focus Paint

Drawing micro-app inspired by 90s MS Paint.

- Canvas-based whiteboard for quick sketching
- Built as an AI-assisted coding experiment exploring multi-agent workflows
- Playground for UI patterns, tools, and micro-interactions
